# Hi!

Time goes very fast. One month likes one minute for me, just kidding. After, I had finished my project. I graduated. YEAH! 4 years in university went very quickly (I am not joking). I thought I was just a freshman. I didn't realize that my age increased. However, I had to accept to the fact, didn't I? By the way, I have stated working for 2 weeks. I was kindly a bit free because at the time I started work, they have started sprint already. Therefore, my work was learning the whole my team's system and a new language, C#. I think the syntax in C# is similar with JAVA. In fact, there are many different things between them. But at least, the concept about OOP is the same. Today I will talk about Web API 2. If you have ever created some web service, you could get it easily. Firtly, the difficult part for me was about routing.In Web API 2, there are 2 kind of routing. The former is convention-based routing, creating template and let Web API matches. The latter is attribute routing, write full url in each method. I prefer the attribute method rather than convention-based method because url and method is in the same file. It is easier to read.

We have backend so the next thing we need is frontend. I am now interested in React. I like its component concept. It likes playing jigsaws. Hence, I will use React to create an example website for testing my service.

Testing is one of the most impotant things to do as well but many programmers usually overlook it. Today, I will use NUnit to create unit tests for my service.

# Let's get start
