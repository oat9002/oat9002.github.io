# Hi 2019!

Time flies incredibly fast, another 1 year. Last year, there were a lot of things happened either good or bad. 
It was another year that gave me an experience immensely.

## Manage your thinking

Many things can make you feels stress. Not even from the work but also from your closed relation, like family. 

## Start inventing something

## Go to concert!
