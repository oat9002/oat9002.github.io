# Hi 2019!

Time flies incredibly fast, another 1 year. Last year, there were a lot of things happened either good or bad. 
It was another year that gave me an experience immensely.

## Manage your thought

Many things can make you feels stress. Not even from the work but also from your closed relation, like family. 

## Start investing something

Last year I intended to invest in something which I can do it easily. At that time, cryptocurrency was very popular and looked liked I had a hope to get some profit. I invested without any knowledge of it. As a result. I lost almost 50% in 1 week. But I didn't give up. I consistantly invested every month. Try to average the lost. Nevertheless it's stil lost lol. Anyway I don't give up my hope to see it rises someday. 

## Go to concert!

I think this is my first year start going to concert, korean concert. I have listened to korean song for few years because of my friend. She recommened me to listen `Give love` by AKMU. When I fisrt listened to it. I really liked it.
