# Hi, NGINX!

Some of you might know about NGINX. Some of you might not. So mayne it is good to explain about it a bit. From official [website](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/), it is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. This is a first couple of sentences from website. Maybe this is too abstract, to explain in the pragmatic way, it is the tool which can help you manange the request that come into the server. For instance, if there are more than 1 service in you servers, NGINX can help you redirect the request to the correct service.

Today I will show you how to setup the NGINX for your backend API. Let's get started!
