# Hi!

It's been a while I haven't written this thing. I saw many people wrote what they have done last year. Thus, I should do as well, lol.

## Working

Yeah, It's time to work. I graduated in June so the first thing I should do is find some jobs. Eventually, I got a job at Agoda. It's good isn't, it? Actually, I don't know but I think it's a good start.Because of here, I'm in the world of C# and Scala which I haven't learned about it :)

## Do something

Couple of months when I started working, I found that I had so much leisure time and I wanted to improve my skill. So, I think about it but I have no idea at all. One day, I talked with my father and I knew that my father was trading gold at that time. Normally, he has to go to some websites to check the gold's price. But if it's me, I was lazy to do that. What about installed some apps to get a notification? His phone storage almost full. Chat bot might be a good way out! My family always use a chat application called "Line" It's very popular here and there is chat bot feature for it. I started to study about Line chat bot and finally, I got "GoldPriceTracking" which is a Line official account. It will send a message every time the gold's price is changed. I use Node.js for the backend. I will try to add more features for it, for example, graph to see history of price(now there is this but not good). If you're interested, Don't hesitate to add to be one of your life. ^_^

## Let's hunt

One of my favorite game is Monster Hunter. It's game that you and your friend help each other to hunt a dragon. It's very funny. Firstly, I played it on PSP (Playstation portable) but until it moved from PSP to Nintendo Ds, I haven't played it. I have heard that it will launch on PS4 (Playstation 4) in January 2018. I have some games I want to play on PS4 too. It's time to buy something to buy something to be a gift for myself after hard working for half year lol. I just got a slim model because I don't have 4k TV so Pro model isn't necessary
