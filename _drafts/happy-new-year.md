# Hi!
It's been a while I haven't written this thing. I saw many people wrote what they have done last year. Thus, I should do as well, lol.

## Working
Yeah, It's time to work. I graduated in June so the first thing I should do is find some jobs. Eventually, I got a job at Agoda. It's good isn't, it? Actually, I don't know but I think it's a good start.Because of here, I'm in the world of C# and Scala which I haven't learned about it :)

#Do something
Couple of months when I started working, I found that I had so much leisure time and I wanted to improve my skill.
