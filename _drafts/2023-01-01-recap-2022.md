# Hi

This time, every year, It is kind of traditional that everyone is writing summary what they have done in the past year. I'm one of them as well, hahaha. For me, I roughly summarize into 3 topics. Let's see what they are.

# Being a software engineer for 5 years

Last year, 2022, I have been working as a software engineer for 5 years. Time flys very fast. I don't feel like I have been working this long. There was a change happened to me as well. I changed the team! Even though, it was not like starting from zero but I have been in a role that I needed to mentor other people. It was quite challenging. Anyway, let's see how it is going to be in the next year.

# Read some books

I was starting reading some books last year. I would say that it was my new hobby. Starting with `Bitcoin Standard`. This book made me knew how money was invented, how money was developed and how bitcoin came into the picture.

# Investment

It has been couple of years that I started investing in something.
