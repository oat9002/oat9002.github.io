# Hi!

It's been a while I haven't wrote any thing. Today I will talking about one of the most popular tech meetup event in Thailand, "ReactBkk 3.0". Why do I say the most popular? Becasue the tickets were sold in **12 seconds !**. However, I'm the one of that 12 seconds :grin:. What I will write after this, It might be have only keyword in some topic sbecause I couldn't note all what spekers said and sometimes I lost focus. Anyway let get started.

## React in 2018 

Start with the summary about React in 2018. They talked about 3 topics below

- Deprecated 3 component life cycles 
- Re-architech react native 

## Static web with gastby.js 

This topic they demonstrated how to build the static website with gastby.js. If you love React and love writing a blog. You should try this!

## Static with next.js 

This is like the previous topic but they used next.js instead. If you don't want to learn about GraphQL, you can try this one.
