# Hi!

It has been a while I haven not wrote any content. Anyhow, because of this, I have something to write hahaha. This is my first time joining dotnet conference. To be honest, I have never thought I would join or do anything which relates to dotnet. In the past, when I heard about dotnet. I felt that it is kind of old-fashioned technology. Not sure why I thought like that at that time. Perhaps because I saw dotnet framework used in legacy application or the application which has 90s user interface. However, my thought is changed. After I have to use C# in my work and they introduce dotnet Core. Everything is changed. It is open source and able to run cross platform. I am very happy to use it everyday. Due to during covid pandemic, this conference was hold online at 23 Jan 2021. Moreover, it's free conference and no limit for seats. Let's see what this conference give us!
