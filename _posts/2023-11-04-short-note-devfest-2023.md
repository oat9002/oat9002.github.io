Today, I have a chance to join developer event called **Devfest Bangkok 2023** which is set up by GDG Bangkok. This is my very first time join to this event. By the way, because I don't really use Flutter or create application. So in some session which relates to that I don't really much play attention to it lol. Let's see what we have.
