# Hello

This year is one of the most difficult year I think. Not only for me but for other people as well. There was a big pandamic spreading across the world and it made me to work form home. A lot of thing change but I still be able to survive lol.
There was a time I have to wait for the email if I got to be lay offed or not. Such an exciting moment. Anyway I'm still lucky so I still work in the same company.

This year is very difficult, however, I hope that next year will be better!

# See ya!
