It has become a tradition every year for many people to reflect on their experiences in the past year. A lot happened in 2024, both good and bad. All of these experiences have shaped me in some way.

# Get to know more people

Starting from late 2023, I began using dating apps. Before that, I thought dating apps weren't good. However, it wasn't that bad; I'm not sure if I was just lucky, but I met many wonderful people. This helped me understand my likes and dislikes better. Even though I haven't been successful in a relationship yet, I've learned a lot from the experience. Let's see what this year brings as I turn 30. Hahaha.

# Back to exercise

It had been a very long time since I exercised regularly. I tried multiple times to go to the gym and play my Nintendo Ring Fit, but I failed. Thanks to a friend, I was reintroduced to the world of badminton. I used to play badminton when I was young, more than 10 years ago. It's a really fun sport when you play with friends. Moreover, it burns a lot of calories. Because of this, I was able to cure my NAFLD (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). I'm becoming healthier, bit by bit.

# Spend to something a little big

I had been contemplating this for a couple of years but never made a decision. It was about buying a car. I really wanted to buy one, but I was obstructed by the lack of parking space at home, as my parents' car occupied the space. However, in September, the car I wanted went on sale at an auction. That made me think, "Okay, this is the time." It might be very difficult to get a chance like this again. So, I decided to buy it and was able to manage parking space. It wasn't factory new; it was a 4-year-old car in very good condition. Since I won't be driving it every day, there was no point in buying a factory-new one. Additionally, second-hand prices are much more valuable if you can find a car with low mileage. I bought it, and I hope it will last at least 5 years.
