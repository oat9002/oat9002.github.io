title: Javascript Bangkok 2.0.0
---

Hi, long time no see! It's been a while since I've joined a tech meetup event. I saw that JavaScript BKK 2.0.0 is happening this year, so I'm excited to participate. I used to attend JavaScript BKK 1.0.0 a long time ago. There's no way I'm missing this one!

Below are some short notes I took during the event. Please note that they don't cover everything, and they're handwritten, so they might be a bit messy. Hopefully, you can still get some value from them.
