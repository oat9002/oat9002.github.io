# Hi,

First of all, I'd like to say Happy new year!. You are very strong that you can survive till now. And today, it is time for every year that we are writing the recap what we encountered last year. Personally, it wasn't that good start because I was sick early last year hahaha. It was both feeling for this year, good and bad. Here is what I encountered

# 8 years of software engineer

It was very surprise that I have been working in this area for 8 years. Moreover, I am stil in the company that I was graduated. It looks like very long time but I didn't feel that long. I'd say this year I didn't learn much new thing on coding side. I did more on designing and presentation which I didn't like that much. In order to growth, this is inevitable. Although, I wasn't promoted but I was kind of learn a lot how should I prepare those things. Let's see next year if I can go through.

# AI is comming fast

In 2022, there was an company called **OpenAI** had launched product called **chatGPT** which is a AI-powered chatbot that can understand and generate human-like text responses through natural conversation. It was very hyped at that time and everyone started using it. I did try as well as was very surprise about it. However, I didn't think that it would be developed this fast. Just for 3 years, it was developed until lots of big company start using it with their business. I can't imagine that what is going to happen in the next few years.

I might be laid off because AI can code so well these days hahaha. However, I will try to focus on learning AI so that it can improve my productivity and still be able to be in this area.
