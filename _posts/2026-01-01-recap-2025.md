title: Recap 2025

# Hi,

First of all, I'd like to say **Happy new year!** You are very strong that you can survive till now. And today, it is time for every year that we are writing the recap what we encountered last year. Let’s take a look at what the year was like for me!

# 8 years of software engineer

It is surprising that I have been working in this field for eight years. Moreover, I am still with the same company I joined after graduating. While eight years seems like a long time, it hasn't felt that long to me. I would say that this year, I didn't learn many new things on the coding side; instead, I focused more on design and presentations, design is okay but documenting I didn't enjoy that much.

However, I realize this is inevitable for professional growth. Although I wasn't promoted this year, I learned a lot about how to prepare for those higher-level responsibilities. Let’s see if I can move up next year.

# AI is comming fast

In 2022, a company called OpenAI launched a product called ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot capable of understanding and generating human-like text through natural conversation. It was highly hyped at the time, and everyone began using it. I tried it myself and was very surprised by its capabilities. However, I didn't expect it to develop this quickly. In just three years, it has evolved to the point where many major companies are integrating it into their business operations. I can’t imagine what will happen in the next few years.

I might get laid off because AI can code so well these days! (Haha). However, I am going to focus on learning AI so I can improve my productivity and remain competitive in this field.

# In chocolate chip, No! relationship heh

I never thought it would actually come true. I started using dating apps back in 2024, but I wasn't in any serious relationships. Eventually, I realized that finding a committed partner that way would be very tough. You don't even know the basic background of the person you're talking to—for instance, is she actually single? So many questions kept coming up. Because of that, I decided to stop using apps and go back to the traditional way: meeting people through friends.

I actually met her in 2023, but at the time, she was just a friend of a friend. There was a trip last Christmas that she happened to join. While I was driving home, we had our first real conversation that went beyond just saying "hi" or asking how she was doing. I think that was the moment I became interested in her.

After that trip, we started dating. A lot has happened since then—both good and bad—and we went through a bit of a "situationship" phase. But finally, we are officially in a relationship! We’ve only been together for a couple of months, but for some reason, it feels like it’s been a year. I really hope it continues to go well in the future.

This is my recap 2025.

See you next time!
