# Hi, Javacript Bankgkok 1.0

It has been a while I haven't been to any big tech event. This is my first event and might be the last event for this year..... because of covid-19. Javascript is one of the most popular language these days. You learn once you can use it for both backend and frontend. Such a cool lang ha. However, for this post, When I am writing. It is 5 months later from the event date, 8 Feburary 2020, so I almost forget everything hahaha. Thus, this post will be just a short note for the topic which I can recall lol.

## A journey of building large scale reusable web components

## End-to-End type safe GQL
