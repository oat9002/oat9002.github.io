# Hello

This year went so fast!. I don't feel I do anything much lol. However, this year we still get the effect from the pandemic, although we should not get much. Anyway, it is what it is. Let's get to the recap in my 2021

## Got promotion

So this year I got promoted to a senior level. More level, more responsibility I would say hahaha. Need to mentor new joiners. Made some decision in more important things and one of the difficult thing for me is interviewing someone to join the company. I was really stressful when I knew that I needed to do this. Because I didn't think that I was good enough to be able to interview someone or like judge someoen if he/she is good or not. Nonetheless, it is a duty and sooner or later, I will need to do it anyway. Thus, I prepared a lot for my first interview and the result was okay I though lol.
