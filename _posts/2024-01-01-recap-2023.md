title: Recap 2023
---

Hello!, it is this time again for every year. Time to recap what I have done so far in the last year. I feel like last year pass quite fast. Not sure if I'm really enjoy or something else lol. As always, I will summarize only 3 bullets point (Just lazy to do it more). Let'
s see what are those things.

# Almost going to be 3 ish years-old

Yeah, this year I'm going to be 30 years old. In the past, I really thought that if I was 30 years old, I will be very mature. In fact, I feel no different when I became 25 lol. My colleagues who are around my age also no different. Perhaps, it is good that we still feel young. However, body doesn't feel young. I start to hear my body like "please take care me better". Healthcheck's result isn't that good so I think it is the time to be serious on the health.

# Finally got a macbook

# Keep reading and coding
